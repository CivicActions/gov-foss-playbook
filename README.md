This repository has two documents under development now:
Playbook for complying with the Federal Source Code Policy (M-16-21)
Best practices for government acquistion of FOSS

Both documents are very much living documents right now and I expect they will change and get split into multiple documents as they grow longer. Feel free to make a pull requestion with additional material or open a issue with suggestions for additional content.
