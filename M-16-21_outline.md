# Federal Source Code Police (M-16-21)

Date: 2016-8-8

## Background:
* U.S. Gov spends $6 billion on software each year
* 42,000 transactions
* Most code is preexisting solutions
* If not preexisting solutions exist then a custom solution may be paid for
* Agencies do not always make the custom code available for re-use by other agencies
* Agencies don't even always share or realize when they could share code on a Government-wide basis
* failure to share custom code solutions  results in duplication of acquisition efforts and inefficient use of taxpayer dollars
* A number of companies have moved in the direction of making source code broadly available for public inspection, improvement, and reuse

## Purpose & Benefits

 Purpose of the policy is seeks to address the challenges by ensuring that new custom-developed Federal source code is made broadly available for reuse across the Federal Government

Benefits include:
* Consistent with Digital government Strategy's "Shared Platform" approach
* enables federal employees to work together - within and across  agencies - to reduce codes and increase consistence in delivering information
* Decrease duplication of costs for the same code
* Reduce Federal Vendor lock-in, which tends to reduce competition and with it cost and inovation

Establish a pilot program where at least %20 of new custom developed code is released as Open Source software for three years
 
Making code available to public also has additional benefits
* government has the opportunity to benefit from community published improvements to Federal custom-developed code
* collaborative environment makes it easier to conduct peer-review and security testing,  reuse existing solutions, and share technical knowledge
* vendors competing for future maintenance or enhancements can do so with full knowledge of underlying source code

# Scope
* Applies to all source code that is custom-developed for the Federal Government
* Only Applies to custom-developed source code going forward (since August 8, 2016)
  * Does not apply retroactively
  * Agencies are encouraged to revisit existing custom-developed source code and release as open source software under this policy
* Agencies must adopt internal policies to implement this policy

## Checklist
* [ ] Obtain sufficient rights to custom developed code to allow the code to be released as open source software
  * The rights required to allow the code to be released as open source also allow government-wide reuse
* [ ] Update procurement policies to require an evaluate agency priorities and existing Federal technology solutions prior to starting the procurement process for any technology or custom code development
  * [ ] 1(a) "Strategic Analysis" - Consider the agency mission, operational needs, and public and [interagency initiatives](https://www.performance.gov/cap-goals-list)
  * [ ] 1(b) "Alternatives analysis" - determine if agency should use an existing Federal software solution, or acquire a new solution (preference should be give to using an existing solution)
    * [ ] Use existing Federal solution if it exists
  * [ ] 2 Consider existing commercial solutions
	* Note: Free and open source software is commercial software)
  * [ ] 3 Consider Custom Development
	* [ ] Obtain sufficent rights to allow publication in open source pilot program
	* [ ] Obtain sufficent rights to allow government-wide code reuse 
	* [ ] Evualute value of publishing source code as free and open source software
	* [ ] Publish source code as free and open source software 

## Factors to consider
* [ ] Require the use of open standards where practicable
* [ ] Give preferences to hybrid approaches to solution architecture that build on existing Federal solutions
* [ ] Give preferences to modular architectures that will facilitate future reuse of Federal solutions
* [ ] Determine if cloud computing is safe and secure option 
* [ ] Consider agencies operational needs:
  * [ ] total life cycle cost of ownership
  * [ ] security and privacy protections
  * [ ] interoperability
  * [ ] ability to share or reuse
  * [ ] resources required to switch vendors at a later date
  * [ ] availability of quality support

## Exceptions
* There are exceptions See Section 6 of M-16-21
* Policy does not apply to National Security Systems (NSS) as defined by 40 U.S.C. sec. 11103
