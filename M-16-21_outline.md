# Federal Source Code Police (M-16-21)
Date: 2016-8-8

##Background:
 * U.S. Gov spends $6 billion on software each year
 * 42,000 transactions
 * Most code is preexisting solutions
 * If not preexisting solutions exist then a custom solution may be paid for
 * Agencies do not always make the custom code available for re-use by other agencies
 * Agencies don't even always share or realize when they could share code on a Government-wide basis
 * failure to share custom code solutions  results in duplication of acquisition efforts and inefficient use of taxpayer dollars
 * A number of companies have moved in the direction of making source code broadly available for public inspection, improvement, and reuse

## Purpose & Benefits

 Purpose of the policy is seeks to address the challenges by ensuring that new custom-developed Federal source code is made broadly available for reuse across the Federal Government

 Benefits include:
 * Consistent with Digital government Strategy's "Shared Platform" approach
 * enables federal employees to work together - within and across  agencies - to reduce codes and increase consistence in delivering information
 * Decrease duplication of costs for the same code
 * Reduce Federal Vendor lock-in, which tends to reduce competition and with it cost and inovation

 Establish a pilot program where at least %20 of new custom developed code is released as Open Source software for three years
 
 Making code available to public also has additional benefits
   * government has the opportunity to benefit from community published improvements to Federal custom-developed code
   * collaborative environment makes it easier to conduct peer-review and security testing,  reuse existing solutions, and share technical knowledge
   * vendors competing for future maintenance or enhancements can do so with full knowledge of underlying source code

# Scope
  * Applies to all source code that is custom-developed for the Federal Government
  * Only Applies to custom-developed source code going forward (since August 8, 2016)
    * Does not apply retroactively
    * Agencies are encouraged to revisit existing custom-developed source code and release as open source software under this policy
  * Agencies must adopt internal policies to implement this policy
  
# Checklist
 [ ] Obtain sufficient rights to custom developed code to allow the code to be released as open source software
	* The rights required to allow the code to be released as open source also allow government-wide reuse
 [ ] Update procurement policies to require an evaluate agency priorities and existing Federal technology solutions prior to starting the procurement process for any technology or custom code development
	[ ] 1(a) "Strategic Analysis" - Consider the agency mission, operational needs, and public and [interagency initiatives](https://www.performance.gov/cap-goals-list)
	[ ] 1(b) "Alternatives analysis" - determine if agency should use an existing Federal software solution, or acquire a new solution (preference should be give to using an existing solution)
	[ ] Use existing Federal solution if it exists
 	[ ] 2 Consider existing commercial solutions
	 * Note: Free and open source software is commercial software)
	[ ] 3 Consider Custom Development
		[ ] Obtain sufficent rights to allow publication in open source pilot program
		[ ] Obtain sufficent rights to allow government-wide code reuse 
		[ ] Evualute value of publishing source code as free and open source software
		[ ] Publish source code as free and open source software 

## Factors to consider
 [ ] Require the use of open standards where practicable
 [ ] Give preferences to hybrid approaches to solution architecture that build on existing Federal solutions
 [ ] Give preferences to modular architectures that will facilitate future reuse of Federal solutions
 [ ] Determine if cloud computing is safe and secure option 
 [ ] Consider agencies operational needs:
	[ ] total life cycle cost of ownership
	[ ] security and privacy protections
	[ ] interoperability
	[ ] ability to share or reuse
	[ ] resources required to switch vendors at a later date
	[ ] availability of quality support



## Exceptions
  * There are exceptions See Section 6 of M-16-21
  * Policy does not apply to National Security Systems (NSS) as defined by 40 U.S.C. sec. 11103
